The dashboard provide valuable insights such as:

* Education wise attrition

During the process of building this dashboard, I learned various techniques such as:

* Data analysis and cleaning

* Using Excel formulas and functions

* Creating pivot tables

* Designing the dashboard

* Slicer formatting

* Create various charts such as pie chart, donut chart, bar chart,column chart, treemap, funnel chart and to format them.
